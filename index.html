				Hello and welcome to the Tam High Computer Science and Machine Learning Club homepage. If you are interested in learning
				how to program, taking your skills farther, or creating amazing projects the Computer Science and Machine Learning club is for you. Don’t
				worry if coding sounds intimidating or if you are basically a pro, everyone is welcome.
			</p>
			<p>
				This year, we plan on hosting hackathons and game jams in which everyone will participate. If you have an amazing idea, 
        but are unsure of how to express it in code, our talented array of <a href='officers.html'>Club Officers</a> will help you make your CS dreams reality.

        Recentaly Linus built an auto encoder that distills pictures of number 
        down to three number before creating recreations.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is an autoencoder? It is a neural network that takes an input, simplifies it, then recreates it. (If you don’t know what a neural network is we will walk you through it)
      </p>

      <p>
         An autoencoder starts to get useful when you split up the halves. 
         For example you could distil an image down into just three numbers 
         then reconstruct it from scratch. This would allow you to transmit 
         three numbers instead of a 28 X 28 grid. You can see this in action 
         in the video below. If you want to learn how to do cool things 
         like this get in contact.
